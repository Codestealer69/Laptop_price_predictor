## Laptop Price Prediction Model
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for a machine learning model designed to predict laptop prices based on various features. The model is implemented using Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## How it Works
The model utilizes linear regression to predict laptop prices. It preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values and creating dummy variables for categorical features. StandardScaler is used to scale the features and target variable. The model is then trained on the scaled data.

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset containing laptop information is loaded and preprocessed. Missing values are handled, and dummy variables are created for categorical features.

2. Model Training: The features and target variable are scaled using StandardScaler. Linear regression is then applied to train the model.

3. Prediction: The trained model's prediction score is calculated, indicating its accuracy in predicting laptop prices.


In this case it might have guessed it right but in our model the precision is not that great for detecting malicious links.
## Installation
To import the libraries-
- mport numpy as np
- import pandas as pd
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Installation method for the libraies are:


```bash 
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
- Or you can just git clone the code but please change the path files according to your local machine
```git clone https://github.com/Sayan-Maity-Code/Laptop_price_predictor/blob/main/Laptop_price_predict.py```


- Install with npm

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/Sayan-Maity-Code/Laptop_price_predictor/blob/main/Laptop_price_predict.py
cd Laptop_price_predict
```
